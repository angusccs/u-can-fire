      <!-- Why Stages Section -->
      <section>
        <h2>Already Know Your Stage?</h2>
        <!-- <p>
          Most personal finance advice is scattered and overwhelming. Stages give
          you the structure you need to focus on the <em>right</em> things first
          — not everything at once.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A clear purpose</li>
          <li>A simple checklist</li>
          <li>What to avoid</li>
          <li>Canadian-specific guidance</li>
          <li>Resources to learn more</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Money gets much easier when you know exactly what comes next.</p> -->

        <p>
          This website was built by someone who learned about money early from a
          few lucky encounters — and realized how powerful, life-changing, and
          simple the fundamentals really are.

          I made this because financial literacy shouldn’t feel intimidating. If
