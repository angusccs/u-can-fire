        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          I first learned about money through an aunt who introduced me to the
          idea of “passive income.” The concept that money could work for me
          — that not every dollar had to come from hours on a clock — felt almost
          magical. It didn’t match anything I’d been taught about work or
          success, and it sparked a curiosity that never really went away.
        </p>
        <p>
          My real foundation started with a small pamphlet called “If You Can.”
          It was simple, almost deceptively simple, but it opened the door to
          everything that followed. From there, I read the books it recommended
          and began piecing together the fundamentals:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>the psychology of money</li>
          <li>how behaviour matters more than intelligence</li>
          <li>the benefits of low-cost index funds</li>
          <li>basic asset allocation principles</li>
          <li>what long-term investing actually looks like</li>
          <li>the data behind buy-and-hold strategies</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As I learned more, I realized two things:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>The basics of personal finance are surprisingly simple.</li>
          <li>Most people never get a clear, structured explanation of them.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          In Canada, financial advice is often scattered across blogs, videos,
          and banks — each with their own angle, assumptions, or jargon. People
          get overwhelmed, confused, or discouraged before they even start.
        </p>
        <p>
          I built U CAN FIRE because I wanted a place where Canadians could
          get:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>clear steps</li>
          <li>no judgment</li>
          <li>no upsells</li>
          <li>no ads</li>
          <li>no noise</li>
          <li>just the essential building blocks of financial stability</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This isn’t meant to replace professional advice. It’s meant to give
          you a foundation — the understanding and confidence to make better
          decisions and move through your financial life with a bit more clarity.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I benefited from learning these ideas early, I think others
          should have that chance too.
