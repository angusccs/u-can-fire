        <h1>About U CAN FIRE</h1>

        <p>
          I learned the basics of money from a short pamphlet and a few
          clear books — simple ideas that changed how I think about work,
          saving and investing. From there I focused on the essentials: how
          behaviour matters, why low-cost index funds work, and how to build
          a stable financial foundation.
        </p>

        <h2>Why I built this</h2>
        <p>
          Financial advice in Canada is scattered and often noisy. I built
          U CAN FIRE to give a direct, judgment-free place with clear steps
          people can follow — no ads, no upsells, just practical guidance.
        </p>

        <h2>What the name means</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>U</strong> — you (and a nod to learning).<br>
          <strong>CAN</strong> — Canada (and a reminder you can learn this).
          <br>
          <strong>FIRE</strong> — Financial Independence, Retire Early: not
          necessarily quitting work, but having the freedom to choose.
        </p>

        <h2>A different mindset</h2>
        <p>
          This project encourages a quieter approach: focus on your goals,
          spend intentionally, and ignore comparison. Financial independence
          isn’t about deprivation — it’s about building options that suit your
          life.
        </p>

        <h2>How this helps</h2>
        <p>
          This site isn’t a substitute for professional advice. It’s a place to
          learn the basics, build confidence, and take the next practical step
          toward financial resilience. If learning these ideas helped me, I
          want others to have the same head start.
