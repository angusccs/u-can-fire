        <h1>Stage 1 — Stabilize Your Base (Mini Emergency Fund)</h1>
        <p>
          The first step toward financial stability is building a small emergency
          fund. Even $1,000–$2,000 can make a meaningful difference when life
          throws something unexpected at you. This cushion creates breathing
          room so you’re not relying on credit cards or loans when something
          goes wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
          A starter emergency fund also helps you break out of the cycle of
          “one setback = new debt.” Once this buffer is in place, everything
          else becomes easier — budgeting, debt repayment, saving, and making
          long-term decisions. It doesn’t need to be perfect; it just needs to
          exist.
        </p>
        <p>
          This stage is about building momentum. You don’t need to optimize
          anything yet. Focus on putting aside a modest amount in a safe,
          accessible high-interest savings account (HISA), and get comfortable
          tracking your basic expenses.
        </p>
