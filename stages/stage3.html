        <h1>Stage 3 — Build a 3–6 Month Safety Buffer</h1>
        <p>
          A full emergency fund protects you from job loss, medical expenses, or
          unexpected life events. Unlike the starter fund in Stage 1, this
          buffer is meant to cover your essential living expenses for several
          months, giving you real peace of mind and financial stability.
        </p>
        <p>
          You don’t have to save it all at once. Many people build this buffer
          slowly over time — even a few hundred dollars per month makes steady
          progress. The purpose is not to chase returns, but to create security
          and reduce anxiety.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once this fund is complete, you can confidently move on to investing
          and optimizing without worrying that one setback will undo your
          progress. This stage is often the turning point where finances stop
          feeling chaotic and begin to feel manageable.
        </p>
