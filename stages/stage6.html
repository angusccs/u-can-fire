        <h1>Stage 6 — Long-Term Freedom (FI Basics &amp; Planning)</h1>
        <p>
          When you’ve built stability, eliminated debt, saved a buffer, and
          started investing, you’re ready for long-term planning. This stage
          focuses on refining your goals — whether that’s Coast FI, early
          retirement, traditional retirement, or simply having more flexibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, you’ll look at your savings rate, investment allocation,
          long-term projections, and lifestyle choices. You’ll start asking
          questions like: “How much is enough?” “What do I want the next decades
          of my life to look like?” and “How do I balance enjoying today with
          preparing for tomorrow?”
        </p>
        <p>
          This stage isn’t about perfection. It’s about intentionality —
          aligning your money with the life you want, not just the life you
          happen to fall into.
        </p>
