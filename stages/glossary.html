        <h1>Glossary</h1>

        <h2>A–B</h2>

        <h3 id="avalanche-method"><a href="#avalanche-method">Avalanche Method (Debt Repayment)</a></h3>
        <p>A strategy where you pay off debts starting with the highest interest rate first, regardless of balance. This saves the most money in interest.</p>

        <h3 id="asset-allocation"><a href="#asset-allocation">Asset Allocation</a></h3>
        <p>How you divide your investments between things like stocks, bonds, or cash. It affects your risk and returns.</p>

        <h3 id="buy-and-hold"><a href="#buy-and-hold">Buy and Hold</a></h3>
        <p>Long-term investing where you regularly buy investments and keep them for many years, ignoring short-term market ups and downs.</p>

        <h2>C–F</h2>

        <h3 id="coast-fi"><a href="#coast-fi">Coast FI</a></h3>
        <p>A stage where you’ve invested enough early that your money can grow on its own to reach your retirement goal — meaning you can “coast” and only need to cover your living expenses from work, not save aggressively.</p>

        <h3 id="cdic"><a href="#cdic">CDIC (Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation)</a></h3>
        <p>Government insurance that protects money in Canadian bank accounts (up to certain limits) if a bank fails.</p>

        <h3 id="etf"><a href="#etf">ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund)</a></h3>
        <p>A low-cost, diversified investment that bundles lots of stocks or bonds into one product. ETFs are popular in Canada for simple, hands-off investing.</p>

        <h3 id="emergency-fund"><a href="#emergency-fund">Emergency Fund</a></h3>
        <p>Cash savings set aside for unexpected expenses like job loss or car repairs. Your “starter” fund is $1,000–$2,000; your full fund is 3–6 months of expenses.</p>

        <h3 id="financial-independence"><a href="#financial-independence">Financial Independence (FI)</a></h3>
        <p>Having enough savings and investments that you can choose how much you want to work, or not work at all.</p>

        <h2>G–I</h2>

        <h3 id="hisa"><a href="#hisa">HISA (High-Interest Savings Account)</a></h3>
        <p>A bank account that pays higher interest than a regular savings account. Good for emergency funds or short-term savings.</p>

        <h3 id="index-fund"><a href="#index-fund">Index Fund</a></h3>
        <p>A type of investment that tracks a whole market (like the S&amp;P 500 or a Canadian index). Index funds are simple, low-fee, and widely recommended.</p>

        <h3 id="investment-risk"><a href="#investment-risk">Investment Risk</a></h3>
        <p>The chance that the value of your investments goes up or down. Higher-risk investments often grow more over time but fluctuate more.</p>

        <h2>J–M</h2>

        <h3 id="long-term-investing"><a href="#long-term-investing">Long-Term Investing</a></h3>
        <p>Buying investments and holding them for many years (often decades), instead of trying to time the market or trade frequently.</p>

        <h3 id="margin-account"><a href="#margin-account">Margin Account</a></h3>
        <p>A type of account that lets you borrow money to invest. Not recommended for beginners.</p>

        <h2>P–S</h2>

        <h3 id="payday-loan"><a href="#payday-loan">Payday Loan</a></h3>
        <p>A very short-term loan with extremely high interest rates. These are considered dangerous because debt grows fast.</p>

        <h3 id="rrsp"><a href="#rrsp">RRSP (Registered Retirement Savings Plan)</a></h3>
        <p>A tax-deferred account where contributions reduce your taxable income now, and you pay tax later when you withdraw in retirement.</p>

        <h3 id="savings-rate"><a href="#savings-rate">Savings Rate</a></h3>
        <p>The percentage of your income you save or invest. Higher savings rates lead to faster financial independence.</p>

        <h3 id="snowball-method"><a href="#snowball-method">Snowball Method (Debt Repayment)</a></h3>
        <p>A strategy where you pay off debts starting with the smallest balance first to build momentum and motivation — even if another debt has a higher interest rate.</p>

        <h2>T–Z</h2>

        <h3 id="tfsa"><a href="#tfsa">TFSA (Tax-Free Savings Account)</a></h3>
        <p>A Canadian account where your investments grow tax-free and withdrawals are tax-free. Useful for all income levels.</p>

        <h3 id="volatility"><a href="#volatility">Volatility</a></h3>
        <p>How much an investment moves up or down in price. High volatility = bigger swings.</p>
