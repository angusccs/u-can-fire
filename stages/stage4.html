        <h1>Stage 4 — Understand TFSA vs RRSP</h1>
        <p>
          Knowing the difference between a TFSA and an RRSP is one of the most
          important parts of Canadian personal finance. Both accounts have tax
          advantages, but they work differently and are better suited for
          different incomes and goals. Once you understand the basics, you can
          make smarter decisions about where to put your money.
        </p>
        <p>
          A general rule of thumb is: use a TFSA if you’re in a lower to
          mid-range income, and an RRSP if you’re higher-income or planning
          long-term retirement contributions. But there are exceptions, and part
          of this stage is learning what fits <em>your</em> situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          You don’t need to memorize every rule. You only need enough clarity to
          know which account aligns with your tax bracket, income stability, and
          future plans. After this stage, investing becomes much more
          intuitive.
